Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my interest in internship and early-career opportunities in Health Informatics, Engineering Operations, Data Analytics, or Technology-focused roles. With a postgraduate background in Health Informatics and a Bachelor’s degree in Biomedical Engineering, I bring a strong combination of analytical ability, technical documentation experience, and data-driven problem-solving skills.

My professional experience includes supporting engineering and clinical teams through structured documentation, workflow analysis, data preparation, and performance reporting. I have contributed to improving system accuracy, enhancing operational workflows, and supporting decision-making processes by building dashboards, analyzing trends, and preparing clear summaries of technical information.

Across roles in engineering and business settings, I have gained hands-on experience in data analysis, documentation development, and cross-functional collaboration. Using tools such as Excel, SQL, and Power BI, I have analyzed datasets, maintained accurate records, and automated reporting processes to increase efficiency and reliability. I consistently focus on clarity, detail, and continuous improvement in all technical and operational work.

I am proficient in SQL, Python, Excel, Power BI, workflow mapping tools, and research-based reporting. My ability to analyze information, manage documentation, and communicate findings effectively allows me to support technical, operational, and project-driven environments. I work well in fast-paced, cross-disciplinary teams and enjoy contributing to process optimization and data-informed decision-making.

I am eager to apply my technical skills, analytical mindset, and documentation experience to contribute to an organization’s goals while continuing to grow professionally. Thank you for taking the time to review my profile. I welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background and interests align with potential opportunities.

Sincerely,
George Erasto Maleko
